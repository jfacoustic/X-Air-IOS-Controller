## X-Air 12 Controller
### Joshua Felton Mathews

This is my final projects for Computer Networks Fall 2018 at Colorado Mesa University.

It is an IOS app that controls my wireless mixer.  I use SwiftOSC to communicate with the mixer, although I plan on forking its original repo to make it better suited for my own project.

The current IOS apps to control X-Air mixers are too bulky for me to use when I am performing, so I thought it would be fun to make my own alternative.  I've already started using this at gigs.
